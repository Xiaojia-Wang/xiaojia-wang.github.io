I am a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at University of Michigan. I have been working on fundamental problems in various flow systems. Specifically, my doctoral research is focused on the [fluid--structure interactions (FSIs) of microscale flows in compliant conduits](research.md). Now, I am working with Professor Silas Alben on biomechanics. I combine mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to rationalize exsiting experiments and provide new physical insights.
