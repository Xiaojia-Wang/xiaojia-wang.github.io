I am a fourth-year PhD student of School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. I have been working on fundamental problems in various flow systems. Specifically, my doctoral research is focused on the [fluid--structure interactions (FSIs) of microscale flows in compliant conduits](research.md). I combine mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to rationalize exsiting experiments and provide new insights into microscale FSIs.

I am currently looking for a postdoc position. Feel free to contact me at [wang4142@purdue.edu]()!
