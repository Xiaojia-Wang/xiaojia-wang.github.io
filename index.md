I am a fourth-year PhD student of School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. I have been working on fundamental problems in various flow systems. Specifically, my doctoral research is focused on the fluid--structure interactions (FSIs) of microscale flows in compliant conduits. I have built a general theoretical framework, with which I can analyze the steady responses, the nonlinear dynamics and the stability of the microscale FSI system. My discoveries rationalize several previous experiments and provide new insights for microscale FSIs.

I am currently looking for a postdoc position. Feel free to contact me at [wang4142@purdue.edu]()!
