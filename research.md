## Doctoral Research

Microscale fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) have aroused the attention of the scientific community because internal flows in compliant micro-conduits are 
often encountered in microfluidics. Although previous studies investigated the microscale FSIs from various perspectives, a unified understanding of the physics is 
lacking. My doctoral research aims to put forward a general theoretica framework for microscale flows in compliant micro-conduits. I have constructed a 
**reduced one-dimensional (1D) FSI model**, with which, I have analyzed the **steady responses**, the **nonlinear dyanmics** and the **stabilities** of various 
microscale FSI systems, providing new insights into the physics of FSIs at the microscale.    

### 1. Inertialess flow in compliant microchannel: nonlinear flow rate-pressure drop relation

### 2. Generalization: microscale FSI with finite fluid inertia

### 3. Towards dynamics: FSI-induced global instabilities


## Past research

1. Steady-state scalings and the linear stability of a one-dimensional system with lubrication flows coupled with nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli Beam.
2. **Master's thesis:** Predicting ship motions in waves using the indirect time-domain method
   - Derived a new Kramers-Kronig relations for ships with forward constant speed
   - Wrote a solver with FORTRAN to predict ship motions in time domain by transforming the hydrodynamic coefficients from the frequency-domian simulations based on the boundary element method
   - Studied the parametric roll of ships by calculating the restoring forces on the instantaneous wet surfaces
